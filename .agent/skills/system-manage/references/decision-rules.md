# Decision Rules

## Priority
1. Keep contracts machine-parseable.
2. Keep IDs stable unless rename is requested.
3. Prefer additive changes over destructive changes.
4. Keep checklist and scenario coverage synchronized.

## Required Checks After Any Definition Change
- All referenced IDs exist.
- Rule IDs remain unique.
- Optional profile references remain resolvable.
- Checklist categories still cover all active rules.
